## How to ingest Marsaglia bit files into R

The initial configuration: I have my Marsaglia bits in the root directory of my external (USB) hard drive, hence their address is: 
1. On Windows: F:\bits.01 and up to F:\bits.60
2. On Linux:   /media/alxfed/toca/bits.01 - bits.60

Here's the instruction. 

```{r}

# Windows version of file opening
# file_to_read = file(description = "F:/bits.42", open = "rb")
# "rb" which means read binary is important on Windows but
# equivalent to "r" on Linux and Unix (they say)

# Linux version of file opening
file_to_read = file(description = "/media/alxfed/toca/bits.42", open = "rb", raw = TRUE)

# Read n raw bytes from the file
A <- readBin(file_to_read, raw(), n = 10000000)
# raw() for bytes, integer() for integers etc.

# Then close the connection
close.connection(file_to_read)
```

We can test what has been read

```{r}
# This is what has been read
print(A[1:10])

# We need to transform the hexadecimal form of the raw
# bytes into integers if we want to use them
# notice that storing the data in the raw form as it was
# ingested stores 3x amount of memory.

print(as.integer(A[1:10]))
```

We can reshape it (in place) to any array by assigning the dimensions
to it.

```{r}
dim(A) <- c(1000, 1000, 10)
```

Here's the array.
